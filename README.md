# Complete Guide to T-SQL for Data Analysts

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the complete guide to T SQL for data analysts. In this repository you will find the following information:

**Setup instructions**<br>
You will find setup instructions for how to install SQL Server, SQL Server management studio, and the necessary databases in the <i>Lesson 01 â€“ Data Concepts and Technical Setup</i> folders <i>README.md</i> file.

**Demo scripts**<br>
You will find all the demo scripts that I go through in each of the lesson folders.

**End of lesson exercises**<br>
You will find all the end of lesson exercises WITHOUT the actual solutions in them because I want to force you to type the actual answers out. Whether you're doing it on your own from scratch or if you're watching my solutions and following along it is important that you actually learn how to write the scripts out, even if at a minimum, it is just copying from the screen to help enforce understanding.
