# Complete Guide to T-SQL for Data Analysts

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the complete guide to T SQL for data analysts. In this repository you will find the following information:

**Setup instructions**
You will find setup instructions for how to install the SQL Server and SQL Server management studio. These instructions are part of Microsoft documentation.

You will find instructions for installing the Adventure Works database as supplied by Microsoft.

**Database creation scripts**
You will find the database creation scripts for the two custom databases which I have created for this course.

**Demo scripts**
You will find all the demo scripts that I go through in each of the lessons.

**End of lesson exercises**
You will find all the end of lesson exercises WITHOUT the actual solutions in them because I want to force you to type the actual answers out. Whether you're doing it on your own from scratch or if you're watching my solutions and following along it is important that you actually learn how to write the scripts out, even if at a minimum, it is just copying from the screen to help enforce understanding.
